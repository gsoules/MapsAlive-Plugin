# MapsAlive (plugin for Omeka Classic)

The MapsAlive plugin lets you display your Omeka content (metadata and images) on an interactive map that was
created with [MapsAlive](https://www.mapsalive.com). MapsAlive is a web application that lets you create
interactive maps, diagrams, and images online.

The MapsAlive plugins works by letting your Omeka installation act as a
[MapsAlive Live Data](https://www.mapsalive.com/docs/livedata-intro/) server that provides the interactive map
with metadata and images from your Omeka items in real time. This way you don't have to copy the data into the
map, and if you update an item in Omeka, the change will automatically be reflected on the interactive map.

The plugin lets you specify the HTML that the map will use to display the data when someone clicks on or touches
a hotspot on the map. The HTML can contain Omeka content from one item or from multiple items. You specify the
HTML and what content it will contain from which items on the plugin's configuration page.
